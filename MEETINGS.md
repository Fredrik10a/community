      - We already appointed people - TC

      - Repo creation is approved
  - New Project: [ETOS](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/issues/57)
      - The project was proposed by Axis
      - Axis intends to use the open source version of the project once the project is fully migrated to GitHub
      - There may be bumps as a small issue has been identified but it should be working fairly well
      - The project is interesting for David and it is in their watchlist
      - If desired, a demo/discussion can be set up for the interested people/organizations
      - It may be good to have a short video published on Eiffel Youtube channel but it may be too much for a video
      - A condensed version of the demo is a possibility depending on the priorities
      - It may be valuable to have this type of recordings/demos for other/all Eiffel projects as well
      - The project is up & running
  - Github roles within maintainer groups and community membership
      - Particulary the [community-maintainer list](https://github.com/orgs/eiffel-community/teams/eiffel-community-maintainers/members) and [eiffel community members](https://github.com/orgs/eiffel-community/people)
      - Each member in a maintainer group can have one of two different roles, member and maintainer.
      - *Members* (as well as *maintainers*) of a maintainer group can work with issues/PRs (accept, label, merge etc) of the associated repositories.
      - *Maintainers* of a maintainer group can also add & delete members of their maintainer group and change their roles
      - Who should be *maintainers* for Eiffel Community organization [maintainer list](https://github.com/orgs/eiffel-community/teams/eiffel-community-maintainers/members?query=role%3Amaintainer)
      - TC chair can be natural member of the team as maintainer
      - TC can appoint/empower few community members as the people to help with administering the Eiffel Organization
      - A suggestion is to allow maintainers to take care of their own maintainer list

      - October 7-8
      - [Registration is open](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/) and free of charge
      - [Ewelina has a talk!](https://sched.co/dqOc)
  - Process/ guidelines on how to contribute and how to join into the community is lacking
      - Information on how to join and contribute needs to be more visable
      - How to add new member to a repository as member?
      - There was very little information about how one can join to Eiffel Community
      - This needs to be documented
      - Other communities have instructions about how to join to community
      - The governance document can be updated to tell people how to join the community https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#contributors
