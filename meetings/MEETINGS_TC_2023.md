### February 2, 2023

(Extra TC meeting)

#### Participants

* TC Attendees
    * Emil Bäckmark, present
    * Magnus Bäck, present
    * Mattias Linnér, present
    * Tobias Persson, not present

#### Agenda and Notes
* Rollcall, All
    * We have quorum.
* Appoint election officers
    - Fatih Degirmenci and Fredrik Fristedt have accepted to be Election Officers for a one-year term ending 2024-02-02.
    - https://hackmd.io/6x1Ef5Y_RWqaOmytMeYVKw#Eiffel-Technical-Committee-Elections-2023
    - Emil: Reach out to them to start by setting the timeline and come back to TC to present it when done
* https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/pull/343 - Did we say step major version for experimental link types
    * Mattias will approve it now.
    * Magnus will consider it one more night before submitting it.
* Discuss issue Eiffel vision/mission - https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/issues/190
    * Compare to distributed tracing. Where do we draw the line? Should there be a spanId attribute in one of the activity events? Should we express an opinion on how deep down in the stack Eiffel should be used (build-as-a-service example)?
    * How far towards the ops space (incidents etc)?
    * Resource monitoring was used an example of what not to cover, but why not? A possible rule that _might_ work is that events that are _only_ useful outside the pipeline but never within the pipeline shouldn't be part of Eiffel. That at least applies to the resource monitoring example. However, Eiffel can include references to where consumers can find resource usage data.
    * Eiffel should be used for events/occurences, not "current status/state".
* Postponed to next weeks TC meeting: Info project now have roadmaps - https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-31-roadmap-in-projects-public-beta/
