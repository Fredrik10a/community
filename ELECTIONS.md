# Eiffel Technical Committee Elections 2021

Eiffel Community is currently being served by a special technical committee named [Bootstrap Technical Committee](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#community-bootstrap-process) (Eiffel BTC) which consists of appointed members as documented in [the governance](https://github.com/eiffel-community/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md#technical-committee-members).

Eiffel BTC determined that the community is ready to move to elected TC which will ensure TC is formed based on meritocracy.

## Election Officers

As documented in the governance, Eiffel Technical Committee and Technical Committee Chair elections will be conducted by the individuals who are appointed as Election Officers by the BTC.

Eiffel TC Committee [agreed](https://hackmd.io/SCImga0nS1qSh3QvsEOAVQ?view#Agenda-and-Notes1) the appointment of the individuals below as Election Officers on March 25, 2021 unless a different community member volunteers to serve Eiffel Community as Election Officers.

* Daniel Ståhl, Ericsson
* Fatih Degirmenci, Ericsson Software Technology

### Update on March 29, 2021

A mail asking for volunteers [has been sent](https://groups.google.com/g/eiffel-community/c/0ww5fjvMCkQ/m/RUaC2Q0uCQAJ) to Eiffel Google Group.

No response from the community was received by the stated deadline so Election Officers appointed by Eiffel TC assume their seats as documented above.
